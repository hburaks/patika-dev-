Question 1:
[16,21,11,8,12,22] steps with merge sort.
Answer 1:
first phase:
[16, 21, 11, 8, 12, 22] -> [[16, 21, 11], [8, 12, 22]]

[[16,21,11], [8, 12, 22]] -> [[[16], [21, 11]], [[8], [12, 22]]]

[[[16], [21, 11]], [[8], [12, 22]]] -> [[[[16]], [[21], [11]]], [[[8]], [[12],[22]]]]

second phase:
[[[[16]], [[21], [11]]], [[[8]], [[12], [22]]]] -> [[[16], [11, 21]], [[8], [12, 22]]]

[[[16], [11, 21]], [[8], [12, 22]]] -> [[11, 16, 21], [8, 12, 22]]

[[11, 16, 21], [8, 12, 22]] -> [8, 11, 12, 16, 21, 22]

[[[[16]], [[21], [11]]], [[[8]], [[12], [22]]]] -> [[[16], [11, 21]], [[8], [12, 22]]]

[[[16], [11, 21]], [[8], [12, 22]]] -> [[11, 16, 21], [8, 12, 22]]

[[11, 16, 21], [8, 12, 22]] -> [8, 11, 12, 16, 21, 22]
